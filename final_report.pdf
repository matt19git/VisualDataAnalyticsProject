Also include in the root directory of your project a PDF file containing a written final report
describing your project and its design process. There are no specific page / word limits,
but 2-4 pages usually are sufficient. This document should contain:
a) At least one screenshot of your final, static visualization.
b) A description of the data. Report where you got the data. Describe the variables. If you
had to reformat the data or filter it in any way, provide enough details that someone
could repeat your results. If you combined multiple datasets, specify how you
integrated them. Mention any additional data that you used, such as shape files for
maps. Pre-processing is important! You are not required to use every part of the
dataset. Selectively choosing a subset can improve usability. Describe any criteria you
used for data selection.
c) An overview of your design rationale. A good rule of thumb to follow is “every pixel
must be justified.” Instead of a 100,000-element breakdown, give us an overview of the
design decisions you made and the trade-offs inherent in how you displayed the data.
This part ought to include a description of the mapping from data to visual elements.
Describe marks and channels you employ such as position, color, or shape. Mention
any transformations you performed, such as log scales.
d) The story. What does your visualization tell us? What was surprising about it? What
insights do you want to convey to the viewer of your visualization?
3. At the end of your PDF file, also include an outline of team contributions to the project.
Identify how work was broken down in the group and explain each group member’s
contributions to the project. Give a rough breakdown of how much time you spent
developing and which parts of the project took the most time.
